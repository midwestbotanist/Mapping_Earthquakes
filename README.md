# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Background/Purpose
This project has been conducted to provide a visual reference for the differing earthquake magnitudes worldwide for the past week. Geographical coordinates with the earthquake magnitudes that occured were obtained vie a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data was utilized from the USGS website.

JavaScript and the D3.js library were chosen to retrieve the data, and then Leaflet library was chosen to plot the data on a Mapbox map via an API request. Doing this allows for an interactive map.
